Got it — you're saying:
Even after the AI "fixed" the buttons, the problem still persists.

That tells me something deeper is wrong — not just "light mode vs dark mode" simple issue.
Let’s go serious mode 🧠🔍 and diagnose this properly:

🛑 Here are the real possible hidden causes why it's still broken:
Button Background and Text Color Are Both Set to White

Maybe the button background-color: white and the text-color: white.

Even in dark mode, if the button itself stays white, only the background of the page makes the text visible.

Global CSS Conflict

Your app may have a global CSS or Tailwind base layer that forcefully overrides button styles.

Example: Some button { color: inherit; } or button { background: white; color: white; } sitting somewhere else in your code.

Or some CSS reset messing with theme switching.

Dark/Light Mode Detection Failure

If you manually coded dark/light switching but only changing background and forgetting text colors, then even if background switches, text color remains wrong.

Hard-coded Color Without Dynamic Styling

If color is hard-coded like text-white on all buttons, it will not automatically adapt to dark or light themes.

Example of bad code:

html
Copy
Edit
<button class="bg-white text-white">Request Consultation</button>
In light mode, this becomes white on white = invisible.

🎯 Here’s what you must do properly to fix it fully:
Use dynamic color that adapts to both modes!

Example if you use TailwindCSS:

html
Copy
Edit
<button class="bg-white text-black dark:bg-white dark:text-black px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Request a Consultation
</button>
OR if it's a colored button like orange:

html
Copy
Edit
<button class="bg-orange-500 text-white hover:bg-orange-600 dark:bg-orange-500 dark:text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">

</button>
✅ Background remains orange in both light and dark modes.
✅ Text remains white and visible in both modes.

💥 Final Solution You Can Tell AI (Updated Perfect Prompt):
Prompt:

"Find all button components.
Ensure that in light mode, the text color is dark enough to be visible on a light background, and in dark mode, the text color remains light enough to be visible against a dark background.

Specifically:

For white backgrounds, use text-black or text-gray-800.

For colored backgrounds like orange, use text-white.

Use Tailwind’s dark: classes to adapt text colors if necessary.

Remove any conflicting global button styles that override text color or background color in dark or light mode."

🚀 Pro Debugging Tip:
To debug yourself instantly, use Chrome DevTools (right-click ➔ Inspect ➔ select the button ➔ check computed styles).

See if the color and background-color properties are correct.

If both color and background are too light, you found the root cause.

Would you like me to give you a "universal" button component ready to drop into your project that will never break again no matter the mode? 🎯✨
