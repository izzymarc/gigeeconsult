      </ol>
      
      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <p>A global professional services firm implemented a "team-first" hybrid model, where teams determine their own working patterns based on the nature of their work and client needs. They established "collaboration days" when most team members are in the office, while allowing flexibility on other days. This approach increased employee satisfaction by 24% and reduced attrition by 15% while maintaining client service quality.</p>
      
      <h2>Common Challenges</h2>
      <p>Organizations often face several challenges when implementing hybrid work:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Culture erosion and reduced social connection</li>
        <li>Work-life boundary management</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Based on our experience working with clients across industries, we recommend the following best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop clear principles and policies</li>
        <li>Invest in both physical and digital infrastructure</li>
        <li>Train managers on hybrid leadership skills</li>
        <li>Create intentional moments for connection</li>
        <li>Regularly assess and adapt the model</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The future of work is not about choosing between remote and in-person but about creating thoughtful hybrid models that leverage the benefits of both approaches. By taking a strategic approach to hybrid work design, organizations can create environments where people can do their best work while maintaining flexibility and work-life balance.</p>

        <li>Local production vs. global cost advantages</li>
        <li>Redundant capacity vs. asset utilization</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Based on our experience working with clients across industries, we recommend the following best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take a risk-based approach to resilience investments</li>
        <li>Leverage digital technologies for visibility and agility</li>
        <li>Develop robust risk monitoring capabilities</li>
        <li>Invest in supplier relationship management</li>
        <li>Create a culture of resilience and adaptation</li>
